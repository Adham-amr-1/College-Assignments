/*
2) Create a class called vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s id and number of cylinders 
in the engine. Then, create a class called truck that is derived from vehicle and has the
following additional proprieties (load capacity in tons (type double) and towing capacity 
in pound (type double)). Be sure that your class has constructor, setter and getter method.
Write a program to test all your methods.
